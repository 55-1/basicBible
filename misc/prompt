@workspace modify the code so the selected book and chapter numbers show in the url.
For example, something like:  http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#/1/5
1 is Genesis, 5 is chapter 5



https://ajbodev.github.io/Bible.html#/1/5




@workspace good, now modify the code so when a visitor visits http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html#/2/6 (for example), the chapters and verses for exodus:6 display

@workspace good, the verses appear on page load.  the list of chapter buttons aren't showing though
